# IPL-win-prediction
This project aims to create a predictive model that calculates the win probabilities for both teams during each ball of an over in the second innings of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match. By delivering real-time win probabilities, the model seeks to enhance the viewing experience for fans and provide strategic insights for teams and analysts.
